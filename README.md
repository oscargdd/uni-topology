#  A YANG Model for User-Network Interface (UNI) Topologies
This document defines a YANG data model for representing an abstract
   view of the Service Provider network topology containing the points
   from which its services can be attached (e.g., basic connectivity,
   VPN, SDWAN).  The data model augments ietf-network model by adding
   the concept of service-attachment-points.The service-attachment-
   points are an abstraction of the points to which network services
   (such as L3 VPNs or L2 VPNs) can be attached.
