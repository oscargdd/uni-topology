    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines a YANG data model for representing an abstract
      view of the Service Provider network topology containing the points from
      which its services can be attached (e.g., basic connectivity, VPN,
      SDWAN). The data model augments ietf-network model by adding the concept
      of service-attachment-points.The service-attachment-points are an
      abstraction of the points to which network services (such as L3 VPNs or
      L2 VPNs) can be attached.</t>

    <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>The User-Network Interface (UNI) is an important architectural
      concept in many implementations and deployments of services such as VPNs
      or managed VoIP services.</t>

      <t>This document defines a YANG data model for representing, managing
      and controlling the User Network Interface (UNI) topology. The data
      model augments ietf-network module <xref target="RFC8345"/> by adding
      the concept of service attachment points. The service attachment points
      are abstraction of the points where network services such as L3 VPNs or
      L2 VPNs can be attached.</t>

      <t>This document does not make any assumption about the service provided
      by the network to the users. VPN service is used for illustration
      purposes.</t>

      <t>In the context of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) <xref
      target="RFC7149"/> <xref target="RFC7426"/>, the defined YANG data model
      in this document can be used to exchange information between control
      elements, so as to support VPN service provision and resource management
      discussed in <xref target="I-D.ietf-opsawg-l3sm-l3nm"/>. Through this
      model, the service orchestration layer can learn the capability and
      available endpoint(s) of interconnection resource of the underlying
      network. The service orchestration layer can determine which endpoint of
      interconnection to add to L2VPN or L3VPN service. With the help of other
      models (e.g., L3SM model <xref target="RFC8299"/> and L3NM model) and
      mechanism, hierarchical control elements could determine the feasibility
      of an end-to-end path and to derive the sequence of domains and the
      points of interconnection to use.</t>

      <t>This document explains the scope and purpose of a uni topology model
      and its relation with the service models and descibes how it can be used
      by a network operator. The document also shows how the topology and
      service models fit together.</t>

      <t>The YANG data model in this document conforms to the Network
      Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) <xref target="RFC8342"/>.</t>

      <section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">
        <t>This document assumes that the reader is familiar with the contents

        terminologies from those documents. Tree diagrams used in this
        document follow the notation defined in <xref target="RFC8340"/>.</t>

            (e.g VPN), although it may support multiple VPNs if each one has
            separate attachment circuits. A CE device can be a router, bridge,

      <t>The service orchestration layer does not need to know about the
      internals of the network. Hence, the abstration&acute;s need is to be
      able to get the set of nodes, and the attachment points associated with
      the nodes from which network services can be requested. Let us consider
      the example of a typical Service Provider network (<xref
      target="sp_network"/>), with PE and P nodes. The Service orchestration
      layer would see a set of PEs, and a set of client-facing ports to which
      CEs can be connected (or are actually connected). Service orchestration
      layer will have also access to a set of Customer Service Model,e.g., a
      L3SM or L2SM models in the customer-facing interface and a set of
      Network models,e.g., L3NM model and Network topology models. In this use
      case, it is assumed that the network controller is unaware of what
      happens beyond the PEs towards the CEs and responsible for the
      management and control of the network between PEs.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
      that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such as
      NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040]. The lowest NETCONF layer is the
      secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport
      is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242]. The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and
      the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS [RFC5246].</t>

      <t>The NETCONF access control model [RFC6536] provides the means to
      restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
      preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
      operations and content.</t>

      <t>There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
      writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the default).
      These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some
      network environments. Write operations (e.g., edit-config) to these data
      nodes without proper protection can have a negative effect on network
      operations. These are the subtrees and data nodes and their
      sensitivity/vulnerability:<list style="symbols">
          <t>/nw:networks/nw:network/nw:node/uni:service-attachment-point/uni:attachment-id<vspace
          blankLines="1"/>This subtree specifies the configurations of the
          nodes in a UNI network topology. Unexpected changes to this subtree
          could lead to service disruption and/or network misbehavior.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
      sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments. It is thus
      important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
      notification) to these data nodes. These are the subtrees and data nodes
      and their sensitivity/vulnerability:<list style="symbols">
          <t>/nw:networks/nw:network/nw:node/uni:service-attachment-point<vspace
          blankLines="1"/>Unauthorized access to this subtree can disclose the
          operational state information of the nodes in a UNI topology.</t>
        </list></t>

    <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
